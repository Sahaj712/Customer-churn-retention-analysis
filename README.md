Customer Engagement & Churn Analysis

This project focuses on understanding customer behavior and churn patterns for a service-based platform. Using the Telco Customer Churn dataset (7,043 customers), the goal is to prepare the data for analysis, build meaningful engagement features, and set the foundation for a retention-focused dashboard.

The dataset has been enhanced with additional behavioral fields—such as support tickets, monthly logins, satisfaction score, and service type—to simulate real-world usage patterns similar to platforms in the insurance and wellness space.

Over the next phases, this project will explore churn trends, engagement segmentation, support performance, and customer value insights, leading to a Power BI dashboard and business-focused recommendations.
