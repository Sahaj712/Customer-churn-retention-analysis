Customer Engagement & Churn Analysis

This project focuses on understanding customer behavior and churn patterns within a service-based platform. The dataset includes customer demographics, contract details, charges, engagement metrics, and newly engineered fields such as support ticket volume, satisfaction score, monthly logins, and usage categories. The objective is to identify the key drivers behind customer churn and prepare insights for dashboarding and business recommendations.

Current Status

-Dataset imported and validated.
-Basic exploratory data analysis completed.
-Data cleaning performed on Total Charges to ensure numeric consistency.
-Preliminary churn segmentation completed across usage, support tickets, and satisfaction.

Early Insights

-Low usage customers show an approximate 82 percent churn rate, indicating that lack of engagement is a major churn driver.
-Customers with five or more support tickets show a 100 percent churn rate, highlighting high support friction as a critical risk factor.
-Customers with satisfaction scores of 1 or 2 churn at 100 percent, while satisfaction scores of 4 or 5 show 0 percent churn, demonstrating that satisfaction strongly correlates with retention.

Business Implications

-Increasing product engagement should be prioritized to reduce churn among low-usage customers.
-High-ticket customers should be flagged as high-risk and addressed proactively through faster resolution and support intervention.
-Customer satisfaction monitoring and recovery strategies are essential to prevent churn among unhappy users.

Next Steps

-Develop visualizations to illustrate churn patterns.
-Build a structured Power BI dashboard.
-Formulate data-driven retention recommendations.
-Document insights and analysis in the final report.
